Replicating published figure results using Julia (Pluto and Jupyter notebooks) from Kepler-Elston el. al, 2001

# Figure Reproduction in Julia

This repository contains Julia-based notebooks that reproduce results and figures from a published study.

The goal of this repository is **reproducibility**: demonstrating how the original figures can be recreated using independent implementations in Julia.

---

## Contents

### Jupyter notebooks (`notebooks/`)
- Bifurcation analysis
- Kepler model simulations
- Catalyst-based models
- Temperature model experiments

### Pluto notebooks (`pluto/`)
- Interactive Julia notebooks used for exploration and visualization

---

## Requirements

- Julia (≥ 1.8 )
- Jupyter Notebook or Pluto.jl

Julia packages may include:
- DifferentialEquations.jl
- Catalyst.jl
- Plots.jl

---

## Reproducibility notes

- Notebooks are organized by model / experiment
- Each notebook recreates specific components of the original figure
- Parameters are documented within notebooks
